# Alfred 

Alfred is a quickly written Bot that can receive notifications, reply to your chats messages, and play Pong with you for our [rails API](https://github.com/kh42z/p42ng)

The idea was to be autonomous and never rely on front-end developpers.

As i tried to follow SOLID guideline, i ended up writting an light [ActionCable library](https://github.com/kh42z/actioncable)
